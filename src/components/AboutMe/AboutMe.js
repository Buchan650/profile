                        <p className={styles.p}>Hello, everyone! My name is Breon Dante Curry, I am 39 years old 
                    and I am an aspiring  web designer living in Gifu, Japan. I have 
                    lived in Japan for almost 16 years, one year as an exchange student 
                    at Hirosaki University and 15 as an English teacher. Iâ€™ve always 
                    had a love for computers and as of March 2023, I decided to make a 
                    career change and began learning  the necessary skills to become a 
                    front-end engineer. My hobbies include Brazilian Jiu Jitsu, weight 
                    training, running, reading and of course coding.</p>
